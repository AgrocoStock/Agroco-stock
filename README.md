# Agroco-Stocks (Next.js scaffold)

This is a deploy-ready scaffold for the **Agroco-Stocks** website (Next.js + React + WebGL logo).
It includes:
- Home, Solutions and Investment pages
- 3D Logo component (react-three-fiber + drei)
- Simple API stub for contact (serverless)
- Instructions to deploy on Vercel from a phone

## Quick steps (phone-friendly)

1. Download `Agroco-Stocks.zip`.
2. Create a GitHub repository (https://github.com/new) named `agroco-stocks`.
3. Upload the unzipped folder contents using "Add file â†’ Upload files".
4. Go to https://vercel.com, Sign up / Log in with GitHub and Import the repo.
5. Deploy. Your site will be: `https://agroco-stocks.vercel.app`

## Notes
- After deploy, install dependencies in the project (Vercel will do this automatically).
- API routes are serverless functions under /pages/api.
- To edit copy, modify files under /pages and /components.
